# DomoticzLife360
This is a Domoticz Plugin for Life 360

You get 3 device types: At Home Presence, Location and Battery Percentage

There are 2 assumptions:
1. This Plugin follows only all the members of the the first circle in your Life360 app.
2. In order to follow Presence, you have to name your location as 'Home' in your Life360 app.
